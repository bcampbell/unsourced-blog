<p>Just a quick note: the Firefox extension for unsourced.org is now ready to try out.</p>
<p><a href="http://hackery.unsourced.org/static/unsourced.xpi">Try it out!</a></p>
<p>Consider it a Beta version. There is more work to do on it and it's Chrome equivalent, so any feedback is most appreciated!</p>
