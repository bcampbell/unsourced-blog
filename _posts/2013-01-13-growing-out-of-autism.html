title: "'Growing out of' autism"
---
<p>A recent <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12037">paper</a> published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry sparked a  whole slew of articles with misleading headlines, stating that some  children can 'grow out of' autism.</p>
<p>Emily Willingham has written an excellent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/01/17/can-people-really-grow-out-of-autism/">critique</a> of these articles for Forbes.com.</p>
<p>In the UK, the national papers jumped aboard the bandwagon with a couple of outright-misleading headlines such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/health/new-study-shows-children-can-grow-out-of-autism-1-2739703">New study shows children can grow out of autism</a> (The Scotsman)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2262822/Children-GROW-OUT-autism-claim-scientists.html">Children can GROW OUT of autism: Controversial research suggests not all youngsters have the same fate</a> (The Daily Mail)</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of the papers went for quotation marks...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9804355/Some-children-grow-out-of-autism-study.html">Some children 'grow out of autism': study</a> (The Telegraph)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/children-can-grow-out-of-autism-psychologists-say-challenging-the-established-view-that-it-is-a-permanent-incurable-condition-8452847.html">Children  can 'grow out of' autism, psychologists say, challenging the  established view that it is a permanent, incurable condition</a> (The Independent)</li>
</ul>
<p>... despite the fact the the 'grow out of' phrase isn't used in the  original paper. Is there a press release somewhere with this quote in  it, or did the papers use quotation marks because they knew it was a  dodgy phrase?</p>
<p>However, The Telegraph redeems itself with '<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9806152/A-spark-of-insight-into-the-mystery-of-autism.html">A spark of insight into the mystery of autism</a>', which seems to represent the research much more accurately.</p>
