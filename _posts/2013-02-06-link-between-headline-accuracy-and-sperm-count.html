title: "'Link' between headline accuracy and sperm count"

<p>A <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2013/01/21/bjsports-2012-091644">recent study</a> about the effects of exercise on men's sperm counts has generated a number of stories in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The study itself suggests that more active men might also have...  uh... more active sperm, but no conclusive link has yet been determined  (there is a <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/February/Pages/exercise-activity-tv-viewing-sperm-count.aspx">writeup</a> on the NHS Choices site). Of course this lack of certainty doesn't stop  the media from reminding us how black and white the world really is -  no pesky gray subtleties for us, thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>What's interesting is the different approaches the various outlets have taken in their headlines.</p>
<p>The Metro and the Guardian seemed to take an optimistic attitude in their (still misleading) headlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metro: <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/05/get-up-and-about-to-help-boost-your-sperm-count-3381006/">Get up and about to help boost your sperm count</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18791">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
<li>The Guardian: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/04/active-men-higher-sperm-counts">Active men have higher sperm counts than couch potatoes watching TV </a><a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18570">(unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Times and the Mail took the more pessimistic angle in their (still misleading) headlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Times: <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article3677911.ece">Men&rsquo;s fertility halved by hours in front of TV</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18530">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
<li>The Daily Mail: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2273566/Watching-TV-long-cuts-male-fertility-half-Study-shows-laziness-leads-drop-sperm-quality.html">Watching TV for too long 'cuts male fertility by half'. Study shows laziness leads to a drop in sperm quality</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18790">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the use of quotes in the Mail headline. This is always a bit of a  warning sign when reporting on such studies - it allows the journalist a  more sensational headline, without taking full responsibility for it.</p>
<p>And finally, there is the more-or-less correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BBC: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21326810">Prolonged TV viewing linked to lower sperm count</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18792">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the Daily Mail, Guardian and the BBC articles all  provide a bit of balance by quoting the same words by the same  independent expert, <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/humanmetabolism/people/pacey">Dr. Allan Pacey</a> at the University of Sheffield. Perhaps he was approached because he has been involved with <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-06/uom-ulh061112.php">previous research</a> on a possible link between lifestyle and sperm quality, and some sort of statement was provided.</p>
<p>UPDATE (11 Feb 2013): I emailed Dr. Pacey asking about this and he told me that the <a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.org">Science Media Centre </a>contacted him, inviting him to comment on the research. He read the paper over the weekend and sent them his views. The then published Dr. Pacey's <a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-new-research-into-physical-activity-tv-watching-and-semen-quality/">expert reaction</a>, along with a <a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/physical-activity-tv-watching-and-semen-quality/">brief analysis</a> of the story for busy journalists. Presumably the SMC then pushed the story out to the papers (or, perhaps with a little wishful thinking, journos picked the story up directly from the SMC site because they know that's a good place to get science stories with some proper analysis and context).</p>
