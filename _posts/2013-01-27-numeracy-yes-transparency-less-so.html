<p><em>As part of their <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/maths-reform/">Make Britain Count</a> campaign, the Daily Telegraph seems to have overlooked a conflict of interest.</em></p>
<p>Last week saw the publication of these two articles in the Telegraph:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9820261/Parents-struggling-with-primary-school-maths-homework.html">Can you pass the primary school maths test?</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/17943">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9820261/Parents-struggling-with-primary-school-maths-homework.html">Parents 'struggling with primary school maths homework'</a> (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/17942">unsourced.org page</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>They cover aspects of a <a href="http://thepearsonthinktank.com/2012/rational-numbers-investigating-compulsion-for-mathematics-study-to-18/">report</a> by Pearson, who describe themselves as "the world's leading learning company" on at least <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/">one</a> of their websites. So Pearson have an obvious interest in the outcome of this research: they'd like to sell more learning materials. That's not to say the research wasn't rigorous and well conducted, but if it had discovered that everyone was just fine with maths, would it still have been published?</p>
<p>While the Telegraph articles do mention that Pearson were behind the study, the company is described merely as 'a publisher'. There is no mention of the conflict of interest.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable for readers to expect that such links would be clearly stated.</p>
