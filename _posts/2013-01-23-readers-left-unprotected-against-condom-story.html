<p><em>New research finds that sex with a condom is just as pleasureable as without. But most news outlets fail to include the fact that the study was funded by a condom manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><a title="A condom as a Chinese dragon by Fred Dunn, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gratapictures/7174774121/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7174774121_fc5dbb42cd_n.jpg" alt="A condom as a Chinese dragon" width="306" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>There's been a slew of stories about recent research finding that the use of condoms does not reduce sexual pleasure.</p>
<p>The paper[1] at the heart of it was written by researchers from the <a href="http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/">Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington</a>, based on a study of data from the 2009 <a href="http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/">National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior</a> (NSSHB).</p>
<p>The NSSHB and various press releases all clearly <a href="http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/23720.html">state</a> that the study is "supported by Church &amp; Dwight, Inc., the maker of Trojan Brand condoms and vibrators".</p>
<p>Leaving aside any other concerns [2], the reporting of this link with industry has been very poor. Of the dozen or so articles I found with a quick web search, very few stated there was a link.</p>
<p>Articles failing to mention the link:</p>

</ul>
<p>So why did only a third of these articles feel the need to mention that a story reflecting positively on condoms was in fact sponsored by a condom manufacturer? It was stated very clearly in all the released press materials. Was it edited out for the sake of brevity or smoother narrative? Was it just deemed an unimportant detail?</p>
<p>The really big question is: how can journalists and publications expect to keep their reader's trust if they willfully omit important facts?</p>

<p>Please note I've no reason to suspect anything amiss with the actual methodology or results. However there are a couple of troubling aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would the research have been published if a strong dislike of condoms had been expressed? I'd suspect not. Such selective publication happens a lot and is a <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2013/01/alltrials-campaign-launches-please-sign-and-spread/">big problem</a>.</li>
<li>The paper is to be published along with other NSSHB results in a special issue of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291743-6109">The Journal of Sexual Medicine</a>. Why a special issue? It could just be that the study has spawned so many interesting results that it justifies it's own space. The more conspiracy-minded might feel the journal is 'fencing' off the industry-sponsored NSSHB results to protect the more 'legitimate' papers. It will be interesting to see how the sponsorship is disclosed in the special issue. Is such sponsorship usual in this field? I've no idea... </li>
</ol>
