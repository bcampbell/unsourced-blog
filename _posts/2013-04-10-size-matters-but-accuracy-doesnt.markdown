What self-respecting paper could resist a study on penis size?
As usual, none of them let the facts get in the way of a good headline:

- telegraph.co.uk: [Size does matter, study finds](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/men_shealth/9979264/Size-does-matter-study-finds.html)
  ([unsourced.org page](http://unsourced.org/art/22141))
- independent.co.uk: [Size really does matter: Homo sapiens' 'larger than necessary' penis may have evolved through natural selection by prehistoric women](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/size-really-does-matter-homo-sapiens-larger-than-necessary-penis-may-have-evolved-through-natural-selection-by-prehistoric-women-8565003.html)
  ([unsourced.org page](http://unsourced.org/art/22059))
- dailymail.co.uk: [Sorry boys, size really DOES matter in the bedroom: Study reveals well-endowed men get the girls](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2305817/Size-really-DOES-matter-bedroom-Study-reveals-endowed-men-girls.html)
  ([unsourced.org page](http://unsourced.org/art/22061))

And as usual, NHS Choices has a [much better](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/04April/Pages/Study-examines-penis-size-and-male-attractiveness.aspx)
writeup.
