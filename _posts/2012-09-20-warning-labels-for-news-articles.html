<p>I'd like to get unsourced.org set up with a good set of warning labels. I've posted <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mst-dev/7xOx1MhKUak/discussion">my ideas so far on the mst-dev mailing list</a>, so if you have some ideas, jump in and let us know!</p>
<p>(or just post comments here and I'll throw them in to the mix)</p>
