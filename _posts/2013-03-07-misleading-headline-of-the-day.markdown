From the Daily Express, amazing news about a cheap drug which drastically
cuts your risk of Alzheimer's:

[3p pill cuts dementia risk by half](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/382149/3p-pill-cuts-dementia-risk-by-half)
([unsourced.org page](http://unsourced.org/art/20418))

Except... it doesn't.

The actual story is that a [clinical trial](http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2013/9194.html)
is about to begin. The aim of this trial is to test
if [losartan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losartan) - a drug usually
used to treat high blood pressure - might also be effective at reducing
the risk of Alzheimer's. Other research has hinted tantalisingly at such
an effect, but no trials have yet been focused down enough to tell for sure.

So that wonderfully optimistic headline in the Express does rather jump the
gun. Sigh.
