[Recent news](http://www.retroconference.org/2013b/Abstracts/47897.htm) about
the apparent cure of a child born with HIV has lead to an amusing outbreak of
quotation-mark headlines.

Some examples from the UK press:

The Guardian bucks the trend with: [US doctors cure child born with HIV](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/03/us-doctors-cure-child-born-hiv)

The use of quotes is understandable. As always, the real story is not
clear cut and more research is needed before any real conclusions can
be drawn. But that "Cure found for HIV!" kind of headline must be
just _so_ tempting to write...

NHS Choices has a [good summary](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/03March/Pages/Reports-of-HIV-cure-are-sadly-premature.aspx).
