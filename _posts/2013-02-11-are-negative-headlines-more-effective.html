title: "Are negative headlines more effective?"
---
<p>Are headlines more effective when they are negative? Someone at the Telegraph seems to think so.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/pupil-premium-how-schools-are-spending-funding-successfully-maximise-achievement">Ofsted report</a>:</p>
<p><strong>"The Pupil Premium: how schools are spending the funding successfully to maximise achievement"</strong></p>
<p>is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9860603/Ofsted-signifiant-minority-of-schools-wasting-pupil-premium.html">reported</a> in the Telegraph as:</p>
<p><strong>"Ofsted: 'signifiant minority' of schools wasting pupil premium</strong>"&nbsp; (<a href="http://unsourced.org/art/18834">unsourced.org page</a>)</p>
<p>Are they trying to take advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias">Negativity Bias</a>? Or do they feel their readers might be receptive to a little Monday morning pessimism?</p>
<p>To be fair, the accompanying <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/news/ofsted-chief-more-schools-using-pupil-premium-good-effect-others-still-struggling-make-real-differen">press release</a> does mention a "significant minority" who are struggling (and even spells "significantly" correctly). But journalists usualy prefer to work from the original source material rather than taking a press release at face value, right? Right?</p>
