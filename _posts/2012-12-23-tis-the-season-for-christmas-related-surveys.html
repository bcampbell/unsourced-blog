<p>The British Heart Foundation tells us: "<a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/media/news-from-the-bhf/christmas-food.aspx">UK adults set to eat as much salt as 50 packets of crisps on Christmas Day</a>". This was picked up by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/9763115/Christmas-Day-could-see-Britons-consume-half-a-pack-of-lard.html">The Telegraph</a>. <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/revealed-the-extent-of-our-greed-at-christmas-1-2704896">Scotland on Sunday</a>, the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/366690/Warning-over-Christmas-Day-calories">Daily Express</a>, and <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2012-12-23/same-fat-as-a-pack-of-lard-eaten-on-christmas-day/">ITV</a>, among others, most of whom chose to emphasise the troubling levels of lard intake rather than the troubling levels of salt intake.<a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/news/75742/almost-three-quarters-of-dog-owners-prefer-buying-presents-for"></a></p>
<p>Another survey says that <a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/news/75742/almost-three-quarters-of-dog-owners-prefer-buying-presents-for">Almost Three Quarters Of Dog Owners Prefer Buying Presents for Pets Over Partners</a>, as reported in the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/366674/Purr-fect-Christmas-presents-for-pets">Daily Express</a>,</p>
<p>Bah humbug. YouGov says "<a href="http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/12/05/brits-spend-less-christmas/">Brits to spend less this Christmas</a>". But that's OK, because hamper company Virginia Hayward tells us "<a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/news/75786/christmas-shopping-will-be-fast-paced-this-year">Christmas Shopping Will Be Fast Paced This Year</a>"!</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>But Christmas is not all peace on earth and goodwill to all retailers. A survey by Buscopan Cramps highlights the seasonal dangers: "<a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/news/75815/jingle-bowels-more-than-a-third-of-brits-suffer-from">Jingle Bowels? More than a third of Brits suffer from abdominal complaints during the festive season</a>". However, an unrelated&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/christmas-stomach-trouble-how-to-avoid-1494753">Mirror</a>, article claims that "This Christmas, &shy;two-thirds of us will suffer from &lsquo;jingle &shy;bowels&rsquo;". A third of us? Two thirds? Who is right?</p>
<p>The Express has a nice roundup of various surveys covering the plight of the christmas card against the forces of rising postage and electronic communications. "<a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/366697/Charities-hit-by-fewer-sending-cards">Charities Hit by Fewer Sending Cards</a>" by <a href="http://journalisted.com/eugene-henderson">Eugene Henderson</a>, covers surveys from <a href="http://www.saga.co.uk/newsroom/press-releases/2012/november/stamps.aspx">Saga</a>, Oxfam and mobile phone network 3. Although it is rather let down by not actually linking to any of the survey data...</p>
