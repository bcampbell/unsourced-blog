title: "Update: firefox extension"
---
<p>Just a quick update to let you all know a Firefox extension for <a href="http://unsourced.org">unsourced.org</a> is under development.</p>
<p>For the technically-minded:</p>
<p>The source code is at <a href="https://github.com/bcampbell/unsourced-firefox">https://github.com/bcampbell/unsourced-firefox</a></p>
<p>It uses the Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/">Add-on SDK</a>, so if you have that installed you can simply clone the github repository above and use "cfx run" to try it out.</p>
<p>The plan is to quickly get the firefox extension on par with the <a href="https://github.com/bcampbell/unsourced-chrome">Chrome</a> one. They can share a lot of the core code, so future improvements should improve both versions.</p>
