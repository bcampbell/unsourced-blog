title: "Illicit sex and free advertising"
---
<p><em>The extramarital affair website illictencounters.com seems to get a lot of free advertising in somewhat surprising places. </em></p>
<p>The practice of conducting a dubious survey producing some 'quirky' finding is a <a href="http://www.merseysideskeptics.org.uk/category/flat-earth-news/bad-pr/">well trodden</a> path for slipping PR material into the media disguised as news.  However, one UK website seems to have honed this proud tradition down to a fine art. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicitencounters.com">illictencounters.com</a> (SFW wikipedia link) and since the beginning of 2012 they have managed to get mentioned by at least  <a href="http://journalisted.com/search?type=article&amp;q=Illicitencounters.com+2012-01-01..2013-02-04">39</a> articles in the UK papers. Of course, stories about sex are always an easy sell, so the website has  a distinct advantage there - it's a 'dating' site for married people in  search of extra-marital flings. But it's still an impressive record.</p>
<p>When we break down this deluge of free advertising we find that the  leader of the pack - with 11 articles - is that bastion of social  liberality, the Daily Mail:</p>
