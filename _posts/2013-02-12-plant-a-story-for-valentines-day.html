<p>In what is surely just an iceberg's-tip of planted valentines day 'survey' stories, Lovefilm has generated a top 10 romantic films list. Mostly via the Press Association, they've got it into:</p>

</ul>
<p>...among other outlets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in a somewhat planted meta-story about planted survey stories, Steve Cooper of hitchedmag.com has written a piece for Forbes, summarising a bunch of the valentine-related surveys he's been sent:</p>

<p>Although there seems to be a conspicuous lack of most-romantic-movie-surveys in his roundup...</p>
