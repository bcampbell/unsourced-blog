This is the blog for unsourced.org

It's implemented with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static file blog
generator.

It's independent from unsourced.org, but the idea is to set
the webserver to serve it from http://unsourced.org/blog/. As a result,
the built-in jekyll webserver probably doesn't help much - I just run a full
web server setup for development, set up like on the live site. I
don't bother with the built-in jekyll server.
